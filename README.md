# Hacker news clone

Tiny project to play around with [Hacker News](http://news.ycombinator.com) API using React/Redux.

## Getting started

To run the project, make sure you have [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com) installed. Then, simply run the following commands:

```bash
$ yarn # installs dependencies
$ npm run serve # starts the webpack dev server
$ npm run build # if you need to build the app statically within `dist` folder
```

## TODO

- [ ] Create a prod webpack env
- [ ] Host it somewhere?
